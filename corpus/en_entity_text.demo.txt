null anarchism is a DBPEDIA_ID/political_philosophy that advocates DBPEDIA_ID/self-governance self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions these are often described as DBPEDIA_ID/stateless societies "anarchism a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies" george woodcock "anarchism" at the encyclopedia of philosophy"in a society developed on these lines the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions" peter kropotkin "anarchism" from the encyclopædia britannica"anarchism" the shorter routledge encyclopedia of philosophy 2005 p 14 "anarchism is the view that a society without the state or government is both possible and desirable"sheehan sean anarchism london: reaktion books ltd 2004 p 85 although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non- DBPEDIA_ID/Hierarchy hierarchical DBPEDIA_ID/Free associations "as many anarchists have stressed it is not government as such that they find objectionable but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state" judith suissa anarchism and education: a philosophical perspective routledge new york 2006 p 7"that is why anarchy when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them when it refuses all hierarchical organisation and preaches free agreement — at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist" DBPEDIA_ID/Peter_Kropotkin anarchism: its philosophy and ideal"anarchists are opposed to irrational (eg illegitimate) authority in other words hierarchy — hierarchy being the institutionalisation of authority within a society" "b1 why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?" in DBPEDIA_ID/An_Anarchist_FAQ anarchism considers the DBPEDIA_ID/state to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful the following sources cite anarchism as a political philosophy: slevin carl "anarchism" the concise oxford dictionary of politics ed iain mclean and alistair mcmillan oxford university press 2003 while DBPEDIA_ID/anti-statism is central"anarchists do reject the state as we will see but to claim that this central aspect of anarchism is definitive is to sell anarchism short"anarchism and authority: a philosophical introduction to classical anarchism by paul mclaughlin ashgate 2007 p 28 anarchism entails opposing DBPEDIA_ID/authority or DBPEDIA_ID/hierarchical_organisation in the conduct of all human relations including but not limited to the state system "my use of the word hierarchy in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocative there is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and state; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality to use the words hierarchy class and state interchangeably as many social theorists do is insidious and obscurantist this practice in the name of a "classless" or "libertarian" society could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom" DBPEDIA_ID/Murray_Bookchin the ecology of freedom: the emergence and dissolution of hierarchy cheshire books palo alto 1982 pg 3"authority is defined in terms of the right to exercise social control (as explored in the "sociology of power") and the correlative duty to obey (as explored in the "philosophy of practical reason") anarchism is distinguished philosophically by its scepticism towards such moral relations – by its questioning of the claims made for such normative power – and practically by its challenge to those "authoritative" powers which cannot justify their claims and which are therefore deemed illegitimate or without moral foundation"anarchism and authority: a philosophical introduction to classical anarchism by paul mclaughlin ashgate 2007 p 1"anarchism then really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life according to individual desires tastes and inclinations" DBPEDIA_ID/Emma_Goldman "what it really stands for anarchy" in DBPEDIA_ID/Anarchism_and_Other_Essays individualist anarchist benjamin tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows "they found that they must turn either to the right or to the left – follow either the path of authority or the path of liberty marx went one way; warren and proudhon the other thus were born state socialism and anarchism  authority takes many shapes but broadly speaking her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress opposing her openly avowedly sincerely consistently universally; second those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third those who distrust her as a means of progress believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon violating and outraging her these three phases of opposition to liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity representatives of the first are seen in the catholic church and the russian autocracy; of the second in the protestant church and the manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third in the atheism of gambetta and the socialism of karl marx" DBPEDIA_ID/Benjamin_Tucker individual liberty anarchist historian DBPEDIA_ID/George_Woodcock report of DBPEDIA_ID/Mikhail_Bakunin 's anti-authoritarianism and shows opposition to both state and non-state forms of authority as follows: "all anarchists deny authority; many of them fight against it" (p 9)  bakunin did not convert the league's central committee to his full program but he did persuade them to accept a remarkably radical recommendation to the berne congress of september 1868 demanding economic equality and implicitly attacking authority in both church and state" anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy many types and traditions of anarchism exist not all of which are mutually exclusive DBPEDIA_ID/Anarchist_schools_of_thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme DBPEDIA_ID/individualism to complete collectivism strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of DBPEDIA_ID/social and DBPEDIA_ID/individualist_anarchism or similar dual classificationsdbpedia_id/geoffrey_ostergaard ostergaard geoffrey "anarchism" the blackwell dictionary of modern social thought blackwell publishing p 14 anarchism is usually considered a radical DBPEDIA_ID/left-wing ideology and much of DBPEDIA_ID/anarchist_economics and DBPEDIA_ID/anarchist legal philosophy reflect DBPEDIA_ID/Libertarian_socialism anti-authoritarian interpretations of DBPEDIA_ID/anarcho-communism communism DBPEDIA_ID/collectivist_anarchism collectivism DBPEDIA_ID/anarcho-syndicalism syndicalism DBPEDIA_ID/Mutualism or DBPEDIA_ID/participatory_economics "the anarchists were unanimous in subjecting authoritarian socialism to a barrage of severe criticism at the time when they made violent and satirical attacks these were not entirely well founded for those to whom they were addressed were either primitive or "vulgar" communists whose thought had not yet been fertilized by marxist humanism or else in the case of marx and engels themselves were not as set on authority and state control as the anarchists made out" daniel guerin anarchism: from theory to practice (new york: monthly review press 1970) etymology and terminology the term is a compound word composed from the word DBPEDIA_ID/anarchy and the suffix DBPEDIA_ID/-ism anarchism DBPEDIA_ID/Online_etymology_dictionary themselves derived respectively from the greek ie anarchy anarchy DBPEDIA_ID/Merriam-Webster onlineanarchy DBPEDIA_ID/Online_etymology_dictionary (from anarchos meaning "one without rulers";

themes can be found in the 6th century bc among the works of DBPEDIA_ID/Taoism taoist philosopher DBPEDIA_ID/Laozi peter kropotkin "anarchism" DBPEDIA_ID/Encyclopædia_Britannica 1910 and in later centuries by DBPEDIA_ID/Zhuang_Zhou zhuangzi and bao jingyan zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist"the priority of dao over tiannature:sky underwrites the themes of dependency and relativism that pervade the zhuangzi and ultimately the skepticism the open-minded toleration and the political anarchism (or disinterest in political activity or involvement)" "taoism" at the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy"doing nothing wu wei is the famous daoist concept for natural action action in accord with dao action in which we freely follow our own way and allow other beings to do likewise zhuangzi the great anarchic daoist sage compared it to "riding on the wind" max cafard "zen anarchy""zhuangzi helps us discover an anarchistic epistemology and sensibility he describes a state in which "you are open to everything you see and hear and allow this to act through you"45 part of wuwei doing without doing is "knowing without knowing" knowing as being open to the things known rather than conquering and possessing the objects of knowledge this means not imposing our prejudices (whether our own personal ones our culture's or those built into the human mind) on the ten thousand things" max cafard the surre(gion)alist manifesto and other writings"the next group of interpreters have also become incorporated into the extant version of the text they are the school of anarchistically inclined philosophers that graham identifies as a "primitivist" and a school of "yangists" chapters 8 to 11 and 28 to 31 these thinkers appear to have been profoundly influenced by the laozi and also by the thought of the first and last of the inner chapters: "wandering beyond" and "responding to emperors and kings" there are also possible signs of influence from yang zhu whose concern was to protect and cultivate one's inner life-source these chapters combine the anarchistic ideals of a simple life close to nature that can be found in the laozi with the practices that lead to the cultivation and nurturing of life " "zhuangzi (chuang-tzu 369–298 bce)" at the internet encyclopedia of philosophy zhuangzi wrote "a petty thief is put in jail a great becomes a ruler of a nation" DBPEDIA_ID/Diogenes_of_Sinope and the DBPEDIA_ID/Cynicism cynics their contemporary DBPEDIA_ID/Zeno_of_Citium the founder of DBPEDIA_ID/Stoicism also introduced similar

books 1962) p 38 in early DBPEDIA_ID/History_of_Islam islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the DBPEDIA_ID/Second_Fitna islamic civil war over the DBPEDIA_ID/Caliphate where the DBPEDIA_ID/Kharijites insisted that the DBPEDIA_ID/imamate is a right for each individual within the islamic society later some DBPEDIA_ID/Muslim scholars such as amer

of boycotting the rulers paving the way to the DBPEDIA_ID/waqf (endowments) tradition which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs but such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not DBPEDIA_ID/Anarchism_and_religion are compatible this is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful DBPEDIA_ID/idolatry the french DBPEDIA_ID/Renaissance political philosopher DBPEDIA_ID/Étienne_de_La_Boétie étienne de la boétie wrote in his most famous work the discourse on voluntary servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedentseveral historians of anarchism have gone so far as to classify la botie's treatise itself as anarchist which is incorrect since la botie never extended his analysis from tyrannical government to government per se but while la botie cannot be considered an anarchist his sweeping strictures on tyranny and the universality of his political philosophy lend themselves easily to such an expansionintroduction to the politics of obedience: the discourse of voluntary servitude by murray rothbard ludwig von mises institute p 18"quite rightly la boëtie recognizes the potential for domination in any democracy: the democratic leader elected by the people becomes intoxicated with his own power and teeters increasingly towards tyranny indeed we can see modern democracy itself as an instance of voluntary servitude on a mass scale it is not so much that we participate in an illusion whereby we are deceived by elites into thinking we have a genuine say in decision-making it is rather that democracy itself has encouraged a mass contentment with powerlessness and a general love of submission""voluntary servitude reconsidered: radical politics and the problem of self-domination" DBPEDIA_ID/Saul_Newman the radical DBPEDIA_ID/Protestant christian DBPEDIA_ID/Gerrard_Winstanley and his group the DBPEDIA_ID/Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in england"anarchists have regarded the secular revolt of the diggers or true levellers in seventeenth-century england led by gerrard winstanley as a source of pride winstanley deeming that property is corrupting opposed clericalism political power and privilege it is economic inequality he believed that produces crime and misery he championed a primitive communalism based on the pure teachings of god as comprehended through reason" kenneth c wenzer "godwin's place in the anarchist tradition — a bicentennial tribute""it was in these conditions of class struggle that among a whole cluster of radical groups such as the fifth monarchy men the DBPEDIA_ID/Levellers and the ranters there emerged perhaps the first real proto-anarchists the diggers who like the classical 19th-century anarchists identified political and economic power and who believed that a social rather than political revolution was necessary for the establishment of justice gerrard winstanley the diggers' leader made an identification with the word of god and the principle of reason an equivalent philosophy to that found in DBPEDIA_ID/Tolstoy 's DBPEDIA_ID/The_Kingdom_of_God_is_Within_You " marlow "anarchism and christianity""although proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism the first was gerrard winstanley (1609 – c 1660) a linen draper who led the small movement of the diggers during the commonwealth winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical christianity against the economic distress that followed the civil war and against the inequality that the grandees of the new model army seemed intent on preserving in 1649–1650 the diggers squatted on stretches of common land in southern england and attempted to set up communities based on work on the land and the sharing of goods" george woodcock

DBPEDIA_ID/Political_Justice (1793)adams ian political ideology today manchester university press 2001 p 116 that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution his aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people’s mental enslavement’ the foundations of law DBPEDIA_ID/property_rights and even the institution of marriage he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organization in each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment the french DBPEDIA_ID/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon is regarded as the first self-proclaimed anarchist a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work DBPEDIA_ID/What_is_Property? published in 1840 it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theorydaniel guerin anarchism: from theory to practice (new york: monthly review press 1970) he developed the theory of DBPEDIA_ID/spontaneous_order in society where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is "liberty is the mother not the daughter of order" in what is property? proudhon answers with the famous accusation " DBPEDIA_ID/Property_is_theft " in this work he

revolutionary DBPEDIA_ID/Mikhail_Bakunin and his DBPEDIA_ID/collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international (which had decided not to get involved with the lpf) they allied themselves with the DBPEDIA_ID/federalist socialist sections of the international who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property at first the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary socialist direction subsequently the international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads bakunin characterised marx's ideas as DBPEDIA_ID/centralism centralist and predicted that if a marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the DBPEDIA_ID/ruling_class they had fought against anarchist historian DBPEDIA_ID/George_Woodcock reports that "the annual congress of the international had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the paris commune and in 1871 the general council called only a special conference in london one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the fédération romande – was used to avoid inviting bakunin's swiss supporters thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the general council's resolutions passed almost unanimously most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers"dbpedia_id/george_woodcock george woodcock anarchism: a history of libertarian ideas and movements (1962) in 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the DBPEDIA_ID/Hague_Congress where bakunin and DBPEDIA_ID/James_Guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were

political celebrities among the labour movement four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution the incident became known as the DBPEDIA_ID/Haymarket_affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day in 1890 a second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight-hour day was made the event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the haymarket affair although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event by the following year the celebration of DBPEDIA_ID/International_Workers'_Day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday in 1907 the DBPEDIA_ID/International_Anarchist_Congress_of_Amsterdam gathered

DBPEDIA_ID/Benoît_Broutchoux DBPEDIA_ID/Emma_Goldman DBPEDIA_ID/Rudolf_Rocker and DBPEDIA_ID/Christiaan_Cornelissen various themes were treated during the congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement DBPEDIA_ID/popular_education issues the DBPEDIA_ID/general_strike or DBPEDIA_ID/antimilitarism a central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and DBPEDIA_ID/syndicalism (or DBPEDIA_ID/trade_union ism) malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a DBPEDIA_ID/social_revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficientextract of malatesta's declaration he thought that the trade-union movement was DBPEDIA_ID/reformism reformist and even DBPEDIA_ID/Conservatism conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it the DBPEDIA_ID/Federación_Anarquista_Ibérica spanish workers federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain the most successful was the DBPEDIA_ID/Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo (national confederation of labour: cnt) founded in 1910 before the 1940s the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics attracting 158 million members at one point and playing a major role in the DBPEDIA_ID/Spanish_Civil_War the cnt was affiliated with the DBPEDIA_ID/International_Workers_Association a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922 with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in europe and latin america in latin america in particular "the

mexico DBPEDIA_ID/Anarchism_in_Brazil brazil peru chile and argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the spanish cnt as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation the largest and most militant of these organizations was the DBPEDIA_ID/Federación_Obrera_Regional_Argentina   it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions" propaganda of the deed and illegalism some anarchists such as DBPEDIA_ID/Johann_Most advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda" by the 1880s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings DBPEDIA_ID/regicide s and DBPEDIA_ID/tyrannicide s from 1905 onwards the russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal ' DBPEDIA_ID/Confiscation expropriations '" DBPEDIA_ID/Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it "the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (" DBPEDIA_ID/propaganda_by_the_deed ") and the anarchist burglars (" DBPEDIA_ID/individual_reappropriation ") expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt" france's DBPEDIA_ID/Bonnot_Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism however as soon as 1887 important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts DBPEDIA_ID/Peter_Kropotkin thus wrote that year in le révolté that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite"quoted in billington james h 1998 fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith new jersey: transaction books p 417 a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the DBPEDIA_ID/trade_union movement the DBPEDIA_ID/anarcho-syndicalism anarcho-syndicalist DBPEDIA_ID/Fernand_Pelloutier argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter" DBPEDIA_ID/Political_repression state repression (including the infamous 1894 french DBPEDIA_ID/lois_scélérates ) of the anarchist and DBPEDIA_ID/labour_movement s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played a role in these isolated acts the dismemberment of the french DBPEDIA_ID/socialist_movement into many groups and following the suppression of the 1871 DBPEDIA_ID/Paris_Commune the execution and exile of many DBPEDIA_ID/communards to DBPEDIA_ID/penal_colonies favoured individualist political expression and actshistorian DBPEDIA_ID/Benedict_Anderson thus writes: "in march 1871 the commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months then DBPEDIA_ID/Adolphe_Thiers versailles seized the moment to attack and in one horrifying week executed roughly 20000 communards or suspected sympathizers a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during DBPEDIA_ID/Robespierre 's ' DBPEDIA_ID/Reign_of_Terror terror ' of 1793–1794 more than 7500 were jailed or deported to places like new caledonia thousands of others fled to belgium england italy spain and the united states in 1872 stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned communards meanwhile the third republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce DBPEDIA_ID/Napoleon_III_of_France louis napoleon 's imperialist expansion – in indochina africa and oceania many of france's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the commune ( DBPEDIA_ID/Gustave_Courbet courbet was its quasi-minister of culture DBPEDIA_ID/Arthur_Rimbaud rimbaud and DBPEDIA_ID/Pissarro were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it the ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the third republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad" according to some analysts in DBPEDIA_ID/History_of_Germany_since_1945 post-war germany the prohibition of the DBPEDIA_ID/Communist_Party (kdp) and thus of institutional far-left political organisation may also in the same manner have played a role in the creation of the DBPEDIA_ID/Red_Army_Faction numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement including tsar DBPEDIA_ID/Alexander_II_of_Russia president

bolshevik revolution however following a political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition the conflict culminated in the 1921 DBPEDIA_ID/Kronstadt_rebellion which the new government repressed anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks; the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to

and where "business transactions alone produce the social order" it is important to recognize that proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance for this reason

not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an DBPEDIA_ID/anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms"the philosophy of anarcho-capitalism” dreamed up by the "libertarian" DBPEDIA_ID/New_Right has nothing to do with anarchism as known by

'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice their self-interested calculating market men would be incapable of practising

represents a minority perspective that actually argues for the total elimination of the state however rothbard’s claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state in its place he allows countless private states with each person supplying their own police force army and law or else purchasing these services from capitalist vendersso what remains

support they created networks of women anarchists DBPEDIA_ID/Lucía_Sánchez_Saornil was a main founder of the spanish DBPEDIA_ID/anarcha-feminist federation DBPEDIA_ID/Mujeres_Libres who was open about

sex manual DBPEDIA_ID/The_Joy_of_Sex the issue of DBPEDIA_ID/free_love has a dedicated treatment in the work of french anarcho- DBPEDIA_ID/hedonist philosopher DBPEDIA_ID/Michel_Onfray in such works as théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire (2000) and l'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques (2002) libertarian education and freethought for english anarchist DBPEDIA_ID/William_Godwin education was "the main means by which change would be achieved" godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness for godwin education had to have "a respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion" "a pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives" and "a concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school" in his DBPEDIA_ID/Political_Justice he criticises state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government" early american anarchist DBPEDIA_ID/Josiah_Warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established"where utopian projectors starting with DBPEDIA_ID/Plato entertained the idea of creating an ideal species through eugenics and education and a set of universally valid institutions inculcating shared identities warren wanted to dissolve such identities in a solution of individual self-sovereignty his educational experiments for example possibly under the influence of the swiss educational theorist DBPEDIA_ID/Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi (via DBPEDIA_ID/Robert_Owen owen ) emphasized – as we would expect – the nurturing of the independence and the conscience of individual children not the inculcation of pre-conceived values"introduction of the practical anarchist: writings of josiah warren" by crispin sartwell DBPEDIA_ID/Max_Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called DBPEDIA_ID/The_False_Principle_of_our_Education in it stirner names his educational principle "personalist" explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation education for him is to create "free men sovereign characters" by which he means "eternal characters  who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment" in the united states "freethought was a basically DBPEDIA_ID/Anti-Christianity anti-christian DBPEDIA_ID/anti-clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters a number of contributors to DBPEDIA_ID/Liberty (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism the individualist anarchist george macdonald was a co-editor of freethought and for a time the truth seeker ec walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal DBPEDIA_ID/Lucifer,_the_Light-Bearer lucifer the light-bearer " "many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as DBPEDIA_ID/Lucifer,_the_Light-Bearer lucifer the light-bearer freethought and the truth seeker appeared in DBPEDIA_ID/Liberty  the church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself" in 1901 catalan anarchist and DBPEDIA_ID/Freethought free-thinker DBPEDIA_ID/Francesc_Ferrer_i_Guàrdia established "modern" or DBPEDIA_ID/Progressive schools in DBPEDIA_ID/Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church the schools' stated goal was to " DBPEDIA_ID/Popular_education educate the working class in a rational secular and non-coercive setting" fiercely anti-clerical ferrer believed in "freedom in education" education free from the authority of church and state DBPEDIA_ID/Murray_Bookchin wrote: "this period 1890s was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where anarchists exercised some degree of influence perhaps the best-known effort in this field was francisco ferrer's modern school (escuela moderna) a project which exercised a considerable influence on catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally"chapter 7 DBPEDIA_ID/anarcho-syndicalism anarchosyndicalism the new ferment in murray bookchin the spanish anarchists: the heroic years 1868–1936 ak press 1998 p 115 isbn 1-873176-04-x la escuela moderna and ferrer's ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of DBPEDIA_ID/Modern schools in the united states DBPEDIA_ID/Cuba south america and london the first of these was started in new york city in 1911 it also inspired the italian newspaper DBPEDIA_ID/Università_popolare founded in 1901 russian DBPEDIA_ID/christian_anarchist DBPEDIA_ID/Leo_Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the tsarist secret police tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture he thought that "education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself  education is culture under restraint culture is free education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary" for him "without compulsion education was transformed into culture" a more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of DBPEDIA_ID/unschooling and the DBPEDIA_ID/anarchist_free_school free school in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches experiments in germany led to DBPEDIA_ID/A._S._Neill a s neill founding what became DBPEDIA_ID/Summerhill_School in 1921 summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practicebritish anarchists DBPEDIA_ID/Stuart_Christie and DBPEDIA_ID/Albert_Meltzer manifested that "as neill is the modern pioneer of libertarian education and of "hearts not heads in the school" though he has denied being an anarchist it would be hard to know how else to describe his philosophy though he is correct in recognising the difference between revolution in philosophy and pedagogy and the revolutionary change of society they are associated but not the same thing" DBPEDIA_ID/Stuart_Christie and DBPEDIA_ID/Albert_Meltzer the floodgates of anarchyandrew vincent (2010) modern political ideologies 3rd edition oxford wiley-blackwell p 129 however although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political DBPEDIA_ID/class_struggle -approach in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se the term DBPEDIA_ID/deschooling was popularised by DBPEDIA_ID/Ivan_Illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead criticisms criticisms of anarchism include DBPEDIA_ID/morality moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or DBPEDIA_ID/utopian by its critics european history professor carl landauer in his book european socialism argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a "lesser evil" than a society without "repressive force" he also argued that "ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears" is an
